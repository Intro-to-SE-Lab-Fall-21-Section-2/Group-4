_**About the project:**_

This is a web-based email client. Some functions it will include (all of which are common to other email clients) are:
  - View emails
  - Forward an email
  - Compose an email
  - Edit an email.
  - Attatch a file to an email
  - Send an email

We plan on using Python to complete this application. Details of other frameworks and languages will be included on this readme as they are decided upon.
